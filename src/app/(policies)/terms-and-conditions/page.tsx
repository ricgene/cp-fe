            </h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              CityPerks includes a loyalty program that allows users to earn and
              redeem points based on their interactions with the platform and
              participating partners. By using CityPerks, you agree to the
              following terms regarding the points and rewards system:
            </p>
            <ul className={styles.list}>
              <li>
                <strong>a. Eligibility:</strong> All registered users of the
                CityPerks mobile app are eligible to participate in the rewards
                program, unless restricted by local laws or app-specific rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>b. Earning Points:</strong> Points are awarded manually
                by CityPerks administrators based on user actions or
                participation in verified activities. These actions may include
                visiting partner locations, attending events, completing
                promotions, or other engagement activities as determined by
                CityPerks. Not all user actions are guaranteed to earn points,
                and the criteria may change without notice.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>c. Redeeming Points:</strong> Users can redeem earned
                points within the app for available perks, offers, or rewards.
                Points are non-transferable, have no cash value, and cannot be
                exchanged for money unless explicitly stated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>d. Expiration and Changes:</strong> Points may expire
                after a certain period of inactivity or at the discretion of
                CityPerks. We reserve the right to modify the rules, available
                rewards, or the structure of the program at any time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>e. Abuse or Misuse:</strong> Any fraudulent, abusive, or
                manipulative behavior (including attempting to falsely trigger
                rewards) may result in the revocation of points and account
                suspension or termination.
              </li>
              <li>
